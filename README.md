A website created using the amazing flexibility of Flutter Framework.

This repo only contains the source code, the released website has been published [here](https://marcotammaro.it).


## Getting Started

If you want to generate your website using this project, get it and edit the source code as you need.

When you have edited all the infos, in order to generate the website files, you need to have flutter installed on your machine.

After you have installed flutter, you can build the project with:
```
flutter build web --release
```
This will generate a ```web``` folder in ```build/web``` with all the files required to let you website work as it should.

Copy and paste all the ```web``` folder content to your hosting provider and the game is done.

## Notes

The website is just a frontend but there is a little backend component used by the contact form; you need to change the POST URL before using the website.
